The housing market is an essential part of the economy, and understanding the factors that influence housing prices is crucial for homeowners, buyers, and policymakers. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in housing price analysis due to significant fluctuations in the market, including the housing price crash that occurred at the end of the 2000s.

Our team has been hired by the Ames, Iowa association of realtors to analyze historical housing data from the 2000s and identify the attributes of houses that influence purchase price. The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately predicts housing prices while identifying the most significant factors that influence housing prices and the quantitative relationship between these factors and price.

This project is critical because it will help our client and other stakeholders understand the drivers of housing prices in Ames, Iowa, and inform decision-making on housing-related matters. Moreover, our client has expressed interest in using the insights gained from this project to inform future analyses of more current housing data. Therefore, the success of this project will pave the way for a more in-depth analysis of contemporary housing data, with the potential to impact the real estate industry in Ames and beyond.
